# Downloading_Demuxing_Adapters
This is a collection of scripts and logs on how to download and demux reads (from sequencing centres and NCBI)

Most of the core scripts are not mine and are described with a lot of detail in YourePrettyGood/ParsingPipeline
Please read it carefully and make sure all the dependencies are installed
